## ‚ùì FAQ

### ü§î What's this?

**batnav** is a **[multiplayer Naval Battle simulator](https://github.com/gerardowacker/batnav)**. Client-server are
extremely needed in a **multiplayer** environment, so this solves the missing variable in the equation.

**batnav-server** is a modular server, that includes an express-coded Rest API, as well as a socket.io-based real-time
connection handler. Everything JS, as the world originally intended.

### ü§î What can it do?

- It handles database connections to fetch required data, but just the right amount. It includes a configurable-database
  manager that can be easily pointed to every modern MongoDB instance.
- It can handle sessions, so you don't have to worry about multiple people logging into the same user simultaneously.
- It handles everything required to create matches between players. In the future, the ability to create custom games
  may be added.
- Apart from the above, it can also set up a matchmaking environment, including rankings and queues.
- Finally, if it wasn't obvious yet, it's responsible for creating real-time connections, with an active packet exchange
  between clients.
